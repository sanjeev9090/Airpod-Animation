Fades and transitions to sync text overlay with scrolling

Minimal dependencies — clean HTML, CSS and JavaScript powered by GSAP

How It Works
Preloads a numbered sequence of AirPods frame images

Listens to the scroll event and computes the scroll fraction

Maps scroll position to a specific frame index

Draws the relevant frame to a <canvas> for smooth animation

Text overlay (e.g. “AirPods Pro”) stays fixed and gradually fades as you scroll.

Installation
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone <repo-url>
cd airpod-animation
You can view it by simply opening index.html in any modern browser—or run via a local server (e.g. live-server, http-server).

Usage & Customization
Inspect and modify frame images in the designated assets folder

Adjust scroll‑to‑frame mapping logic inside script.js

Tweak fade timing or overlay styles in style.css

Leverage GSAP by including gsap.min.js and ScrollTrigger for refined control

HTML5

CSS (for overlay styling & fade effects)

JavaScript with GSAP + ScrollTrigger (for scroll-based animation sequencing)

<canvas> element for frame-by-frame rendering

Inspiration & Credit
This implementation was inspired by Apple’s AirPods Pro landing page, which uses a long series of frame images displayed via canvas element and scroll-triggered JS for a scrub-like video effect
